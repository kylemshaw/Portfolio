//		Project: TravelExperts Database Manager
//		Author: Kyle Shaw
//		Date: August 31, 2021
//		
//		Description:
//		This project was originally built as part of a group  
//		project in the Object Orientated Software Developement
//		Certificate program at the Southern Albera Institute
//		of Technology (SAIT). I have since cleaned it up and have 
//		written 95% +  of the code
//		
//		The app allows travel agents to make changes to three
//		different but related tables stored in a database 
//		running in MS SQL server.

1. TravelExperts_DB_Creation_Script.sql

		Download MS SQL Server Management Studio and run this
		script to create the database that is managed by the
		app.
		
		This script was provided by the course instructor and 
		contains some small modifications made by our group.

2. TravelExperts_DB_Manager

		After the database has been created open this shortcut 
		to run the application exe file.

3. TravelExperts_W4_DesktopApp

		This folder contains the visual studio solution file 
		for the app, providing access to source code. You can 
		also run the app from visual studio using the sln file.
