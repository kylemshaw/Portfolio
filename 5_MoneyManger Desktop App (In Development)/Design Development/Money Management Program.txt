5.Breakdown savings account into sub accounts to better manage


**HOME SCREEN **

- Home screen shows current monthly budget goal breakdown with summary of your progress.

- home page will also show your month by month breakdown of total costs and revenue to summarize if you are making or losing money. this will be unaffected by the current goal and only depend on imported transaction data.

-Home page will also have navigation to other pages

** GOALS **

- a goal consists of your monthly earnings split into differnt major budget categories (fixed costs, investments, savings, guilt free). The amount ot each category is chosen by the user. You can add sub categories to each major category to customize. The user is guided to start with their fixed costs. The percentage of monthly income is automatically updated as they enter each fixed cost category. The user then can choose how to split the rest of their earnings in the remaining major categories by adding sub categories with a budget number. The amount of income left is auto updated whenever user enters a sub category. All user input is error checked with warnings when all income is used up. When income is used up offer to add what is actually remaining to the category. Allow user to easily add and subtract sub categories so they can play around and find something that works.

-users must add sub catergoies to a list before using. This list is editable by the user. If a category is delted the user must be warned that this will remove the category from any existing transactions (the field will just become blank). Need to think if blank category fields will result in transactions lost in database. Categories that are in use by other goals may not be deleted.

- allow goals to be saved. So they can be reused in the future. From list of saved goals allow user to select a goal and make current to add to home screen. if another goal is currently in session provide warning to user and offer choice to keep existing goal or end existing goal and start new one.

-when a goal is selected to be current prompt user for duration of goal and provide tools for them to adjust length to see total projections for each category or enter desired total amount for a category and provide user with required duration.

-You enter number of months that the goal will take. Allow ability to end early or prolong your goal period. If you end early it show results with months not completed counted as zeros. As part of goal setup it will show projections of money when you have reached your goal.

- When a goal is ended provide summary of goal to user. This includes overview of budget projections vs actual outcome. Actual outcome is calculated from imported transations.This summary includes each major category and its sub categories with column for projected and column for actual as a sum of all months the goal was active. Highlight actual values that are over budget (red) and under budget (green) for quick analysis. Provide buffer for highlighting so that if you went over or under by a small amount it does not get highlighted. Maybe offer this error as an option to the user. 

- goal summary will also allow the user to drill down and analyze why they were over or under. by clicking a subcategory that is over/under user is shown months that were over budget with transactions highlighted in the over/under budget sub category


** TRANSACTIONS ** 

- Transaction page will have button for user to import transactions from CSV file. Button click will start tool that guides user through process. All transactions will be uploaded to a single database. 

-During transaction upload process user is required to assign a budget sub category to each transaction. Imported data will have a description field. A screen will show the list of imported transactions with date, description, amount, and sub category. The sub category will be a drop down box. Program will search existing database for descriptions that match newly imported transactions. If a match is found the sub category box will be automatically populated. If multiple matches are found the drop down box will be populated with all matches and highlighted for the user to choose the correct category. Drop down boxes will also allow user to choose from existing categories. Existing categories will be sourced from category list that is created during the goal setup process.

-user must manually go through each transaction before import. This forces user to look through spending and spot any abnomalities

-think about associateing transactions with a certain goal period in time

- Transaction page will allow users to view transactions by setting up a filter by month, type, date, or any of the other database field. Each view will be exportable to CSV file.

- transaction views will also allow the user to edit transactions. Maybe this should be limited to only editing sub categories.

** Cost Records **

- provide cost break downs like grocery cost per month, car, rent, etc for budget planning.

** Bill Requirements **

- Section where you can record all your bills. Includes amounts billing date, payment due date, payment method, and any other notes.

-also include when money is moving between accounts (RSP, savings etc.)

** Savings **

Make savings acount with total amount and sub categories. When a savings transaction is imported it is given a sub category by user. The amount is then subtracted/added from each sub category to keep an up to date balance. Savings spend transactions can be assigned a savings category so they are removed from the monthly budget and subtracted from savings instead.

- Savings are balanced at the end of the month. The amount of savings spent is subtraced from the amount of savings to deposit. If this amount is negative then the difference has to be moved from savings to chequing.

- to make this work set account balance to $500 before pay. Then maintian constant float by doing the above. dont absorb. account is reset to $500 each month.excess going to savings or what ever
